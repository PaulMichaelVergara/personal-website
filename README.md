# Personal Website
Hi, this is my personal website, it is a modern minimalist theme with a dark and light mode toggle feature. The tech stack used were React, Node.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML. To make the light/dark mode toggle feature work, disable your dark mode in your browser. 

It also contains a contact form made in Email.js if you want to get in touch with me.
